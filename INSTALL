spkg - The Unofficial Slackware Linux Package Manager
-----------------------------------------------------

Dependencies
------------

  Judy >= 1.0.3         http://judy.sourceforge.net
  glib >= 2.2.1         general purpose C library
  popt >= 1.7           command line parser
  zlib >= 1.1.4         zlib (de)compression library

  Optional:
  lzma >= 4.32.0beta3   lzma utils: http://tukaani.org/lzma

  Lzma utils are not required on compile time. If you want to install
  tlz packages just make sure you have lzma binary in your PATH.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

If you are creating package that you want to be usable on older systems
i recomend to use --enable-static-spkg=only confiure option. Resulting
binary will be a bit bloated (800kB), but you will be able to use it
everywhere.

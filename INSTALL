spkg - The Unofficial Slackware Linux Package Manager
-----------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions
-------------------------

  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

If you are creating package that you want to be usable on older systems
i recomend to use --enable-static-spkg=only confiure option. Resulting
binary will be a bit bloated (800kB), but you will be able to use it
everywhere.

/** @page cmds_impl Commands Implementation

Common requirements for a command implementation are:
@li only one pass of extracting tgz package is allowed,
@li every command must implement rollback of filesystem changes 
    up to the point when tgz archive is fully extracted,
@li filesystem inconsistency must be as short as possible,
@li allow for pre/post inst/upgr/remove scripts (pre script
    failure may break command execution).

@section ins Install

For each file in archive do:
@li test file path validity
@li test if it is package metainformation file
@li 
@li

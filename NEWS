spkg - Release Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------
2006-07-29: spkg 1.0rc4

  Dropped requirement for minimum glib version down to 2.2.1, that is
  version that comes with Slackware 9.0. Requirement for glib >= 2.10.0
  was pretty tight and allowed spkg to be used only on
  slackware-current. Thanks goes to johnga1 for pointing this out. 
  
  Added configure option for building only static version of spkg
  (--enable-static-spkg=only). This is what I now use for binary package
  on spkg.megous.com. This fixes problem that I did run into when
  downgrading to glib-2.2.0 to test spkg against it. That is all goes
  well until we add first action to the transaction, then suddenly
  g_slice_new0 is needed and not found in any library and spkg
  terminates. This happens for the first file in the installed package,
  and can't break anything. If file aready existed on the filesystem it
  will not be owerwritten when spkg is terminated by the system. No
  problem here. :)
  
  Anyway, spkg is now binary comaptible with any glib from 2.2.0
  to 2.12.x so this problem should not happen even when using
  dynamically linked spkg binary.

2006-07-28: spkg 1.0rc3

  Ok, we are in the rc phase, but this is pretty small change
  code-wise, but a good to have feature. :-)

  Added support for .tlz (LZMA compressed) packages. You will
  need to have lzma program in your path for this to work, unlike
  traditional .tgz packages that could be installed with just only
  spkg.static. I forgot to mention it, but you can use configure
  option --enable-static-spkg to build spkg.static in adition
  to the ordinary dynamic executable.
  
  Dropped support for progress callback from the untar module.
  
  Don't show raw error message when upgrade fails on not installed
  package.

2006-07-26: spkg 1.0rc2

  Build system proted to autotools.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2006-07-20: spkg 1.0rc1

  This release was tested a lot. It can upgrade Slackware 10.1 to 10.2
  without problems. (results are the same as with pkgtools) Everything
  works as expected.

  What's new:
  - Spkg no longer changes permissions of already installed directories.
  - Implement --reinstall and --install-new options to upgrade commad.
  - Show information messages and warnings by default.
  - Add/remove some warnings to make output more readable by human.
  - Improve error messages and some warnings.
  - Added some not so important error checks.
  - Cleaned up package database code.
  - Updated API documentation.
  
  Bugfixes:
  - Add missing dry run check for temporary file deletion.
  - When printing empty slack-desc lines, check for null strings.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------
2006-07-17: spkg beta

  What's new:
  - Spkg is feature complete!
  - Upgrade command implemented. It is not tested very much.
    I've just tested it on the samba package from the slackware
    current and it works same as upgradepkg from pkgtools.
    It's based on the cmd_install() code though, so it should
    work quit well. Time will tell. 
  - Install command refactoring: cmd_install() was split into
    smaller and easilly manageable functions.
  - Memory allocation audit. (confirmed by valgrind and glib
    memory allocation profiler)
  - Root path sanitization. (fixes double slashes when --root /)
  - Improved and more consistent output from commands.
  - Added more warnings where necessary. (permission diferences
    between installed and existing directories, files changed
    after installation, etc.)
  - --dry-run should be now really DRY. :)
  - Perform sanity checks on paths extracted from the doinst.sh
    script.
  - Added dep packages download script, for those who want
    to build static verion of the spkg and don't want to search
    whole day for popt-1.10.2 sources on the internet. ;-)
  - Improved package name guessing algorithm.

  What's comming:
  - There will be refactoring of the transaction code. (it's
    not broken, but it's not quit readable too)
  - Then, I will write automated testsuite and create some really    
    torturous packages to test as much code paths in spkg as
    possible. And of course I will be running spkg in my normal
    day to day use.
  - Finally I would like to update documentation and make some
    benchamrks on the brand new --upgrade command.
  - Please, keep an eye on http://spkg.megous.com/dl/patches/beta/
    for patches that will fix bugs found in this beta release.
    I will be adding patches there as soon as each bug is fixed.
    To date there are no known bugs in spkg.

[pkgtools] document and implement algorithm for installpkg

[*] not implemented semaphores, damnit other locking mech. needed

[pkgdb] get_packages: implement data selector
[pkgdb] when finished, implement missing py bindings

[*] implement safe cleanup mechanisms for cases when user breaks execution

[pkgtools] had a good idea last night, elaborate on it
[pkgtools] add option to disable doinst.sh script preprocessing (because it may not work
           for glibc package, because links are created conditionally)
[pkgtools] implement filesystem transactions
[pkgtools] implement install, upgrade, remove

[filedb,pkgdb] locking should be separate for separate roots

[sys] reimplement sys_rm_rf and sys_mkdir_p in C (should be just some Copy&Paste(tm) from
      my mxm project)

[untgz] use of blockbuf instead of writebuf can speedup things slightly on the user side

[doc] finish readmes
[doc] fix manpage

TODO
----
- pkg structure should be better defined (espec. required and optional fields)
- add full script to database
- add option to do script preprocessing for faster link creation
- implement file transactions
- reimplement sys_rm_rf and sys_mkdir_p in C
- pkgtools: implement install, upgrade, remove
- implement filedb transactions
- finish readmes
- fix manpage
- add somewhere notice, that avl insert code was taken from gnuavl library

PROBLEMS
--------
- sqldb corruption should be checked in sql_open
- sql tranactions should return if db is busy (or try to wait for db)
- filedb distributed checksumming

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
-----------------
- untgz: investigate on the way the symlinks are created (is it suffic)
- untgz: recoverable errors?

POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS
----------------------
- untgz - use blockbuf instead of writebuf can speedup things slightly on the
          user side
- sqlite transaction commit sucks! (few kilobytes 6 seconds)

API USABILTY IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------
- sql: use automatically last prepared query if 0 is passed as query
       to some functions

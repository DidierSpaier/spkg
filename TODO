TODO
----
- sql review (especially error handling)

- implement rm_rf and mkdir_p in C
- i., u., r.
- further optimize untgz (use 32k BLOCKBUFFER)

Status
------
- pkgdb core finished (uh, oh...)


Review
------
 - sql, pkgdb, sysutils


KNOWN BUGS
----------
 Real untgz should delay time setting on directories until after all 
 files/subdirs extracted to it. No need for this.

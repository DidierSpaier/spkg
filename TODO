TODO
----
- add full script to database
- add option to do script preprocessing for faster link creation


- implement file transactions
- reimplement sys_rm_rf and sys_mkdir_p in C
- pkgtools: implement install, upgrade, remove
- implement filedb transactions
- finish readmes
- fix manpage

- sql: use automatically last prepared query if 0 is passed as query
       to some functions

- add somewhere notice, that avl insert code was taken from gnuavl library

PROBLEMS
--------
- sqldb corruption should be checked in sql_open
- sql tranactions should return if db is busy (or try to wait for db)
- pkg structure should be better defined (espec. required and optional fields)
- filedb distributed checksumming
- untgz - too heavy write load (use blockbuf efficiently to write data to a file)

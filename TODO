[filedb] implement "named" filedb (and name semaphores apropriately,
         so that we can really open multiple different filedbs :-))

[pkgdb] pkg structure should be better documented (espec. required and optional fields)
         - how should we handle symlinks in pkgdb? (store or not?)
         - add package installation time info into db
[pkgdb] get_packages: implement data selector
[pkgdb] more open modes (read only - to allow easy access to database for nonprivileged)
[pkgdb] when finished, implement missing py bindings


[pkgtools] pass options using some common structure
[pkgtools] add option to disable doinst.sh script preprocessing (because it may not work
           for glibc package, because links are created conditionally)
[pkgtools] implement filesystem transactions
[pkgtools] implement install, upgrade, remove

[sys] reimplement sys_rm_rf and sys_mkdir_p in C (should be just som Copy&Paste(tm) from
      my mxm project)

[untgz] use of blockbuf instead of writebuf can speedup things slightly on the user side

[doc] finish readmes
[doc] fix manpage

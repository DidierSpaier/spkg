[!*] error reporting from *_open functions possible
[!*] go through code and tests to check if all errors were converted
    to the new error handling

[!filedb] implement filedb transactions and locking (easy)

[pkgdb] get packages should allow for multiple modes of operation (only names, no files and full)
[pkgdb] how should we handle symlinks in pkgdb?
[pkgdb] more open modes (read only - to allow easy access to database for nonprivileged)

[!untgz] write_data and empty files? is that properly handled?

[pkgdb] pkg structure should be better defined (espec. required and optional fields)
[pkgdb] handle package installation time

[untgz] extraction errors. are they too strict or not? :-)
[untgz] machine readable errors? (errnos) (code is in place. just define errnos and return them appropriately)
[untgz] use of blockbuf instead of writebuf can speedup things slightly on the user side

[pkgtools] add option to do script preprocessing for faster link creation
[pkgtools] pass options using some common structure
[pkgtools] implement filesystem transactions
[pkgtools] implement install, upgrade, remove

[sys] reimplement sys_rm_rf and sys_mkdir_p in C

[doc] finish readmes
[doc] fix manpage

spkg -d --copy=dir package ???

list files that can't be removed in removed_packages/package.leftovers ???
  -- why not just do grep on output from spkg?

F. spkg 1.0 should have somewhere a list of important differences in  
behaviour from official pkgtools. Here's a short list:
   1. spkg does not support the -preserve or -copy options of removepkg.
   2. When spkg cannot overwrite a file during install/upgrade it keeps a  
copy as $(name)-##$(operation)##
   3. spkg will not allow installing several different version of a package  
at the same system.

[doc] Write article
[test] Automatic testuite

Use it for a month or so instead of pkgtools everywhere and push
rcX releases after each bug is found and fixed.

- --verify command for checking fs against package database (what files
  changed after installation, missing files, etc.)
- --check command for checking validity of slack packages
  (check for suid binaries and other rights based checks for files,
  enforcing slackware packages policy)

[untgz] using blockbuf as writebuf can speedup things slightly on the 
    user side (approx. by some 5%)
